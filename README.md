# 🧠 DSA-Solutions

This repository contains my **LeetCode** and **Codeforces** solutions.  
I’m documenting my **learning journey** of Data Structures and Algorithms — solving problems daily, writing clean and optimized code, and learning new techniques step by step.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
- 🌱 Beginner to Advanced level problems.
- 💡 Each solution includes comments or explanations of logic.
- 🧩 Covers topics like Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, and more.
- 🕒 Updated regularly as I keep learning.

## 🏁 How I Work
| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Mon–Thu | Solve 1–2 DSA problems (push only meaningful ones) |
| Fri–Sat | Work on projects (new features, bug fixes) |
| Sun | Review, refactor, and update README |

## 🧠 Example Commit Messages
- `feat: solved Two Sum, learned hashmap usage`
- `feat: implemented binary search in rotated array`
- `refactor: improved readability of DP solution`
- `docs: updated README with folder structure`

---

## 🌟 My Goal
To strengthen my **problem-solving ability** and build a solid foundation for **software engineering and interviews**.
